;* Do not confuse PPU memory address with CPU memory address, they are completely separated from each other
;* PPU has its own address space starting from $0000 to $3FFF
;* From $0000 to $0FFF (4KB) is data of Left pattern table (sprites tiles)
;* From $1000 to $1FFF (4KB) is data of right pattern table (background tiles)
;* From $2000 to $2400 (1KB) is data of first name table (background graphic)
;* From $3F00 to $3F0F (16bytes) is data of background colors
;* From $3F10 to $3F1F (16Bytes) is data of sprites colors
;* Copy those values and by using HxD save them separately : mario_spt.chr, mario_bg.chr, mario_bg.nam, mario_bg.pal, mario_spt.pal,
